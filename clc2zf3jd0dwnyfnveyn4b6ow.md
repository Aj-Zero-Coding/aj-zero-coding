Full meaning of¬†MERN

**What is MERN Stack?**

*MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises 4 technologies namely:* MongoDB Express, React, and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

*Using these four technologies you can create absolutely any application that you can think of everything that exists in this world today.*

Now let‚Äôs understand each technology one by one.

[**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/)

*MongoDB forms the M of the MERN stack and works pretty well with the JavaScript ecosystem. M M MongoDB is a NoSQL database in which data is stored in documents that consist of key-value pairs, sharing a lot of resemblance to JSON.*

*a lot of resemblance to JSON. The data is not stored in the form of tables and that‚Äôs how it differs from other database programs. This is how the data stored in MongoDB looks like:*

[Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)

*Express is a flexible and clean Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node-based web applications.*

*Express helps build the backend very easily while staying in the JavaScript ecosystem. It is preferred for self-projects as it helps focus on learning development and building projects pretty fast.*

*In the MERN stack, Express will be used as a backend API server that interacts with the MongoDB database to serve data to the client (React) application.*

[**React js**](https://reactjs.org/)

*React is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It‚Äôs used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.*

*React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML.*

*Almost all the modern tech companies from early-stage startups to the biggest tech companies like Microsoft and Facebook use React.*

*The prime reason why react is used for Single Page Applications(SPA). SPA means rendering the entire website on one page rather than different pages of the website.*

[**Node JS**](https://nodejs.org/en/)

*NodeJS is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, it‚Äôs built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine to run JavaScript code outside the browser, for easily building fast and scalable applications.*

*The main purpose of NodeJS is simple, it allows us to write our backend in JavaScript, saving us the trouble of learning a new programming language capable of running the backend.*

*Node.js is the platform for the application layer (logic layer). This will not be visible to the clients. This is where client applications (React) will make requests for data or webpages.*

**Thank you so much for reading, I hope this is helpful for you.**
