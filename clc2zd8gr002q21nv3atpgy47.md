**Front-end technology roadmap for full-stack web development**

#### **Basic languages**

**HTML**\- HyperText Markup Language is the most basic and must-know for any website you are creating. You define and structure the content of a website.

**CSS**\- CSS is used for styling websites and adding layouts, fonts, and colors.

**SQL**\- Structured Query Language is a basic language used for database management.

### Front-end frameworks

**BootStrap**\- BootStrap is an open-source toolkit for developing responsive, mobile-first projects. It uses HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It helps design a website faster and easier. It has design templates for forms, buttons, tables, navigation, etc., and also supports JavaScript plugins.

**AngularJS**\- This is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. The JavaScript-based open source web framework is maintained by Google and a community of corporations and individuals. They address challenges in a single-page application. It allows the usage of HTML as the template language. Its data-binding and dependency reduce the amount of coding required substantially.

**ReactJS**\- A JavaScript library maintained by Facebook and a group of companies as well as individual developers. React is optimal for fetching fast-changing data that needs to be recorded. It is used for building user interfaces for single-page applications. It allows users to create reusable UI components.

**VueJS**\-This is yet another open-source JavaScript framework for single-page applications and UIs. It is very compact in size and high in performance. The best option for new coders, it offers hand-picked the choicest features of other frameworks like Angular and Reacts. It is known as the most approachable framework today.

### Other programming languages required for a full-stack development

You need to be proficient in multiple programming languages as most of the core processes for any business have to be written in them. It is not possible to master all of them in a short time, so we have a list of languages for you to begin with.

**JavaScript**\- JavaScript is a just-in-time compiled programming language. It helps in adding dynamic features to your website. This is used for both front-end and back-end operations. J

JavaScript basics are easy to learn. Many of the front-end as well as back-end frameworks including NodeJS and AngularJS use JavaScript. It is widely used for applications like chatbots using full stack technology. A Java roadmap framework is vital to any full-stack development role, either junior or senior, in almost all organizations.

**TypeScript**\- Developed and maintained by Microsoft for the development of large applications, TypeScript is a prerequisite if you want to learn Angular, and it has recently become very popular. It is always used along with JavaScript for features like type checking.

**Python**\- Python is a high-level, general-purpose language. It can be used on a server to create web applications, mathematics and server scripting. It connects to databases to read and manipulate files. Python was designed for readability and runs on an interpreter system. It can also be used in a procedural, object-oriented or functional way.

**Ruby**\- A dynamic, open source language, Ruby is easy to learn and code. It focuses on productivity and simplicity, and it can be used for web applications, servers, system utilities, backups and database works.

**PHP**\- PHP is the most popular scripting language, and it can be embedded into HTML. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server where PHP is installed. It is used to collect form data and send or receive cookies amongst other functions.

### Back-end technology roadmap for full-stack web development

Developers need a back-end framework so that an application can be created. It is the sscript sideof a dynamic application. A lot of options are available for back-end frameworks.

**Back-end technology roadmap for full-stack web development**

**Express**\- Express.js is a framework used as a web application for Node.js. It is a module of NodeJS. It can be used for apps that are based on servers that will listen for connection requests from clients. It can be used for single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is fast, easy to use and assertive.

**NodeJS**\- NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform in nature that runs across various platforms. it is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript outside a browser.

**Django**\- Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows model-template-view architecture. It is used to simplify the creation of complex, database-driven websites. It is fast and promotes a clean design.

**Ruby on Rails**\- Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework based on the Ruby language. It provides default structures for databases, web services, and web pages. It uses model-view-controller architecture. This is comparatively hard to learn as you have to learn multiple and independent concepts.

### Database system¬†roadmap

In today‚Äôs scenario, there are tons of databases. Each company develops its own databases according to their requirements.

The objective of this roadmap is to learn and become a database administrator.

**MySQL, SQLite, Postgres**\- These are Relational Database management systems, and the data is stored in table-like schemes. This is good for storing business data. These use SQL

**MongoDB, Cassandra, Apache storm, Sphinx**\- These are the NoSQL databases. Their only commonality is that they do not use a relational database scheme. This type of database covers a wide range of technologies and can be used to find key-value DB, graph DBs, streaming DBs etc.,

**VoltDB and MemSQL**\- These are a new kind of database, the NewSQL. They follow the relational scheme but instead of disks, they use memory. the advantage is that they outperform the traditional RDBMS but the limited amount of memory available is definitely a downside to this type of database.

### Additional skills recommended for full-stack web development

**Git**\-

**Machine Learning**\-

**SSH**\-

**HTTP/HTTPS**\-

**Linux command**\-

**Data structures and algorithms**\-

**.Net and asp.net framework**\-

**Character encoding**\-

#### Conclusion

Full-stack software development has seen a surge in almost every large and small organization in recent years. This roadmap lets you know all the basic and intermediate skills required to become a successful full-stack developer. The more skills you gain, the more your profile gets noticed. Cramped offers training in full-stack development. Engineering graduates can opt for such courses who are looking for better career growth and a good salary.
